# Database transactions

## Tying transactions to HTTP requests

A common way to handle transactions on the web is to wrap each request in a transaction. Set ATOMIC_REQUESTS to True in the configuration of each database for which you want to enable this behavior.

It works like this. Before calling a view function, Django starts a transaction. If the response is produced without problems, Django commits the transaction. If the view produces an exception, Django rolls back the transaction.

### Warning

While the simplicity of this transaction model is appealing, it also makes it inefficient when traffic increases. Opening a transaction for every view has some overhead.

#### non_atomic_requests(using=None)

This decorator will negate the effect of ATOMIC_REQUESTS for a given view:

from django.db import transaction


@transaction.non_atomic_requests
def my_view(request):
    do_stuff()


@transaction.non_atomic_requests(using="other")
def my_other_view(request):
    do_stuff_on_the_other_database()


## Controlling transactions explicitly

Atomicity is the defining property of database transactions. atomic allows us to create a block of code within which the atomicity on the database is guaranteed. If the block of code is successfully completed, the changes are committed to the database. If there is an exception, the changes are rolled back.

atomic blocks can be nested. In this case, when an inner block completes successfully, its effects can still be rolled back if an exception is raised in the outer block at a later point.

-- using decorator
@transaction.atomic
def viewfunc(request):
    # This code executes inside a transaction.
    do_stuff()

-- using context manager
@transaction.atomic
def viewfunc(request):
    create_parent()

    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            generate_relationships()
    except IntegrityError:
        handle_exception()

    add_children()

## Autocommit

In the SQL standards, each SQL query starts a transaction, unless one is already active. Such transactions must then be explicitly committed or rolled back.

This isnâ€™t always convenient for application developers. To alleviate this problem, most databases provide an autocommit mode. When autocommit is turned on and no transaction is active, each SQL query gets wrapped in its own transaction. In other words, not only does each such query start a transaction, but the transaction also gets automatically committed or rolled back, depending on whether the query succeeded.

## Performing actions after commit

Sometimes you need to perform an action related to the current database transaction, but only if the transaction successfully commits. Examples might include a background task, an email notification, or a cache invalidation.

on_commit() allows you to register callbacks that will be executed after the open transaction is successfully committed:

on_commit(func, using=None, robust=False)

transaction.on_commit(send_welcome_email)

-- Callbacks will not be passed any arguments, but you can bind them with functools.partial():
from functools import partial

for user in users:
    transaction.on_commit(partial(send_invite_email, user=user))
